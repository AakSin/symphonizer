## April 4 | Symphonizer

### Idea
Building on Martaâ€™s socket.io app, for out project 2 we want to create a digital web-based instrument that produce sound on the key press. We would like to extend the sound library and include subtle animations coded with P5.js. [Patatap Website](https://patatap.com) serves as our main inspiration for this project. We would like to add the functionality of rooms with a maximum of 2 people and an unlimited number of observers, so that music can be composed without unnecessary interactions from many users. We would also like to expand the audiovisual options, allowing the user to choose from a calm (forest/jazz) or more lively (fire/metalic) symphony.

### Process
We have agreed on the general feel of our application, designed a prototype of it in figma and sketched a general flow between the `client` and `server`. Nextly we have devided work between the two of us and decided on convenient times to check the progrerss.
