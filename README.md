### Idea
Building on Martaâ€™s socket.io app, for out project 2 we want to create a digital web-based instrument that produce sound on the key press. We would like to extend the sound library and include subtle animations coded with P5.js. [Patatap Website](https://patatap.com) serves as our main inspiration for this project. We would like to add the functionality of rooms with a maximum of 2 people and an unlimited number of observers, so that music can be composed without unnecessary interaction from many users.

### Process
We have agreed on the general feel of our application, designed a prototype of it in figma and sketched a general flow between the `client` and `server`. Nextly we have devided work between the two of us and decided on convenient times to check the progrerss.

### Plan
1. Marta: make a general sockets setup;
3. Aakarsh: Figure out logic behind the rooms (join/create room, limit no of users, add spectators);
4. Together: Create animations in P5.js on keyPressed (at least 8 by Thr, 7th)
5. Aakarsh: Create a sound library (by Tue, 12th)
6. Marta: write up documentation
